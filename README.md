With a basic glance on the proposed problem, we find out that the solution to the problem should belong to the classification category since the candidate contesting the election can wether win the election or lose it, it's a case of binary classification. The classifier we'll be using is the Random forest classifier. By using an ensemble classifier we can aim for a higher accuracy and better prediction.
